"""Pick the obligation the portfolio can start right now, and name the command that runs it.

Why a script decides this. Eligibility is arithmetic: which projects a person marked Active, which rows the
board marks Ready, whether the two-project rule in PORTFOLIO.md section 7 leaves a slot, whether a dependency
exists as code. None of it needs a model, and planner.py's own note about Task Master's 36 tools (about 21,000
tokens of context) is the reason not to spend tokens on it: a tool list is context not spent on the code.

Why the board is read through projects_mcp.py. It is the one read surface that already understands Level,
State, Active and the active rule, and its views are pure over items, so this file is testable with invented
cards and no token at all. Reading GraphQL here instead would give the portfolio two ideas of what "Ready"
means, which is the drift this forge exists to prevent. The GitHub MCP server is not the answer for this
question: its `projects` toolset returns titles unless field ids are passed, and it is skipped entirely under
`--read-only`, which is how the `github` server is configured on this machine.

Why nothing here writes. Decision D23: a card is a claim, and a row reaches `[ok]` only in the same commit as a
named test that would fail if the behaviour regressed. So this emits a step and a command; the flip, the gates
and sync_roadmap.py stay in the CLIs that check evidence. Two fields make the boundary concrete: `promote`
names the human action when a project is not yet Active (the board's own readme says Active is a person's
field), and `caveats` carries deps.py's refusal to call a dependency unblocked.

Usage:
    py loop.py next --json
    py loop.py next --project pkix
    py loop.py next --explain
