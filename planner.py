"""The forge's planning surface: read the portfolio, claim work, and update a row - with evidence.

Why this is small. Task Master ships 36 MCP tools and documents that they cost about 21,000 tokens of
context, offering a 7-tool "core" mode at about 5,000. A tool list is not free: every schema is context
not spent on the code. Five tools are exposed, each returning evidence rather than advice.

Why there is no deliberation tool. The failures this portfolio keeps hitting are not "thought too
briefly": they are assertions made without checking - an invented NSS constant, a claimed roadmap status
never read from the file, a check that passed against a stale build artifact. More fluency about a wrong
fact is still wrong. So the write path here is guarded and the read path always names the file or command
it came from.

What is deliberately absent: a task store. beads keeps issues in a Dolt database and Task Master in a
.taskmaster file; either would become a second source of truth for obligations, and ROADMAP.md plus its
named tests is the authority CI can enforce. `claim` and `propose_status` move that authority, they do not
copy it.

Where the writes live (the MCP-writes decision, 2026-11-07: docs/research-mcp-planning-quality.md slice 1). The MCP server is read-only: every tool carries
readOnlyHint, and `forge_propose_status` previews a change and runs the guard but cannot write. The two
writes - flipping a row and claiming its issue - are this module's command line, so each one is a
deliberate act a person or a script runs, not a tool an agent reaches for mid-turn:

    python planner.py status <project> <row> <status> [--write]
    python planner.py claim <project> <row> <login>

The reason is the evidence rule. The guard checks that a named test exists; it cannot check that the test
would fail if the behaviour regressed, so a write reachable from a tool call is a done row one confident
sentence away.
