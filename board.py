"""Build the portfolio's Projects board at the grain the portfolio actually plans in.

Why it changed. The first two layouts filed obligation rows from the three repositories that happen to be on
GitHub and called that the portfolio. PORTFOLIO.md plans in something else: projects with a kind, a tier and a
wave; waves with an exit test ("a wave is not finished when it feels done"); arrows that mean "cannot
deliver behaviour without"; a rule that at most two projects carry real effort at once; and decisions only a
named human can make, which are what actually gates certledger's fetch layer. A board of rows from three
repositories could show none of that.

So the board is a tree, using GitHub's own sub-issues so every level gets a native progress bar:

    Wave (exit test)                         issue in b1tninja/sdk-forge, which publishes PORTFOLIO.md
      Project (kind, state, tier, rows)      issue in b1tninja/sdk-forge: every project, local-only ones too
        Milestone epic (Mn)                  issue in the project's own repository, when it has one
          Obligation row                     issue in the project's own repository (sync_roadmap.py)

and two kinds of native "blocked by" link: a project is blocked by a dependency that is not yet code, and by
an open decision from PORTFOLIO.md section 9 that names it. Field values come from portfolio.py, which reads
PORTFOLIO.md, forge.POSITION and the disk.

What it never does. It does not move Status forward: Ready, In progress, In review and Blocked are a
person's or an agent's call, and Active (the two-project rule) is never written by code. It does not invent
dates, estimates or milestones. It deletes nothing.

The board is chosen by number, never by title: two open boards once shared the title, and a lookup by
title lands on whichever GitHub lists first. The number comes from FORGE_BOARD, else BOARD_NUMBER.

Usage:
    python board.py                                  # plan against the configured board
    python board.py --number 4 --check               # read only; exit 1 on any drift
    python board.py --number 4 --project pkix        # touch pkix's card, epics and rows, nothing else
    python board.py --number 4 --apply
    python board.py --create "A new title" --apply   # refused when any board, closed too, has the title

README = """# Protocol SDK portfolio

The portfolio at the grain `PORTFOLIO.md` plans in, as one tree with GitHub's own progress bars:

**Wave** (with its exit test) -> **Project** (kind, state, tier, rows done) -> **Milestone** -> **Obligation**.

Waves, projects and decisions are issues in `sdk-forge`, the repository that publishes `PORTFOLIO.md`.
Milestones and obligation rows are issues in each project's own repository. A project is *blocked by* a
dependency that is not yet code, and by any open decision in `PORTFOLIO.md` section 9 that names it.

## Authority

`PORTFOLIO.md` decides sequencing and each project's `ROADMAP.md` decides protocol obligations. This board is
regenerated from them by `sdk-forge/sync_roadmap.py` and `sdk-forge/board.py`; editing a card's text is
overwritten. A card cannot make a row done: a row reads `[ok]` only in the same commit as the code and a named
test that would fail if the behaviour regressed.

## Views

- **Portfolio** - every project by priority (P0 is Tier 1), with kind, state and rows done.
- **Waves** - each wave's exit test and how far its projects are.
- **Decisions** - what is waiting on a person, not on code.
- **Work board** - obligation rows by status, one swimlane per repository.
- **Backlog**, **Milestones**, **Current cycle**, **Blocked**, **My items**.

## What is yours to set

**Active** (at most two projects carry real effort at once), Status beyond Backlog and Done, and Cycle.
