@WHY@

## The gap, with a date

PyPI was queried on @SURVEY_DATE@ for this name and for every neighbouring project. Landscape
claims rot quickly: two projects in this portfolio shipped within five days of the survey,
which is why the table below carries dates instead of adjectives.

@PRIOR@

What this project intends to add:

@GAPS@

## Specification spine

Status and publication dates below were read from the RFC Editor record on @SURVEY_DATE@. A
section number is cited only where that section was read in full; everything else cites the
document, which is the honest grain size for a plan. See [docs/rfc-map.md](docs/rfc-map.md).

The last line is the one that matters most in a protocol library. `-O` strips `assert`, and a
parser whose bounds checks were asserts stops being a parser under production flags. Wire
paths raise named exceptions; asserts belong in tests and nowhere else.

ROADMAP = """
# Specification completeness -- and the roadmap it implies

This is the project's north star: every protocol obligation @NAME@ could plausibly take on,
with an honest status against the code at `HEAD`. It is blunt about gaps on purpose. A
roadmap that overstates its coverage is not a plan, it is marketing.

**The honesty rule:** a row may read `[ok]` only when a named test would fail if the
behaviour regressed. Reading the code and agreeing with it is not enough. That is how
"decoded but never sent" quietly becomes "implemented".

Legend: `[ok]` implemented and pinned by a named test -- `[part]` partial, with what is
missing stated -- `[ ]` not implemented -- `[no]` deliberate non-goal.

A Where cell marked `(to be written)` names the test that will pin the row once it exists; no
such test has been written yet, and the row cannot leave `[ ]` until it has. The Milestone
column places the row on the ladder in section 2, and `-` means it is not placed yet.

Update the affected row in the same commit that changes the behaviour. A row and its test
drift apart within one release, and the document becomes useless exactly when it is needed.

## 1. Obligations

@ROWS@

## 2. Milestones

@STEPS@

Every milestone is accepted by its rows above flipping to `[ok]` with a named test, not by
the code existing. Coverage in `pyproject.toml` ratchets in the same commit.

## 3. Errata watch

@ERRATA@

## 4. Deliberate non-goals

@NONGOALSROWS@

## 5. Open questions

@OPEN@

## 6. Publication checklist

- [ ] every `[ ]` row above either `[ok]` or moved to a named later milestone
- [ ] `docs/research.md` claims re-verified and the dated ones either promoted or deleted
- [ ] interoperability evidence recorded in `docs/` against a non-Python implementation
- [ ] `tools/check_dist.py` proves the wheel ships the fixtures the README promises
- [ ] version 0.1.0 tagged, trusted publisher configured, README badges uncommented

# Contributing

Short version: four gates, and they all have to pass on Linux and Windows.

```bash
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
mypy @PKG@
pytest -q --cov
python -O -m pytest -q
```

## The three rules that cause the most arguments

1. **`assert` belongs in tests and nowhere on a wire path.** The fourth gate strips
   asserts, and a parser whose bounds checks were asserts stops being a parser in
   production. On a parse path, raise a named exception.
2. **A behaviour change updates its ROADMAP row in the same commit.** The row flips to
   `[ok]` only with a named test. A row and a test drift apart within one release, and the
   matrix becomes useless exactly when someone needs it.
3. **Cite the document, not a blog post.** A section number is allowed only if that section
   was read. `docs/rfc-map.md` records what was verified and when.

## Layout

| Tier | Home | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Core | `@PKG@/` | specification behaviour only; dependency-free unless README says why not |
| Apps | `@PKG@/apps/` | composes core pieces, adds no new protocol surface |
| Examples | `examples/` | one runnable script per use case; never restates library logic |

A pattern graduates from `examples/` to `apps/` on the second user, stated rather than
assumed.

## Tests

Protocol tests are vectors first: bytes in, structure out, with the source of the vector
cited. `hypothesis` is welcome for codecs, and every fuzz-found crash becomes a fixed
regression test rather than only a property.

## Milestones

Pick a row from the matrix, not a feature from your imagination. If the row you want is
missing, add it to the matrix first and argue for it there.
"""

SECURITY = """
# Security policy

## What this project treats as a security property

- **Hostile input is the normal case.** Every decoder has to refuse truncation, over-long
  lengths, nested structures and contradictory fields without raising anything a caller
  cannot name.
- **Bounds before cleverness.** Size, count and depth limits exist on every parse path, and
  they are configuration rather than suggestions.
- **No silent crypto policy.** Weak or deprecated algorithms are refused by an explicit
  policy object rather than accepted because they happen to parse.
- **Provenance is part of the answer.** A result states what was verified, what was cached
  and what was skipped, so a caller cannot mistake an unchecked field for a checked one.

## assert is not a safety mechanism

`python -O` strips asserts. Any invariant that protects a parser boundary or a verification
result must be expressed as a raised exception. CI runs the suite under `-O` for exactly
this reason.

## Reporting

Open a private security advisory on the repository rather than a public issue. The policy is
the Apache Software Foundation's: security support for the main branch and the most recent
release. Because this repository is a pre-alpha shell, a report will often be answered with
"that code does not exist yet", which is a different thing from "it will not be fixed".
"""

CHANGELOG = """
# Changelog

The format follows Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

## Unreleased

Nothing yet. This repository is a shell: the public surface exists as typed stubs that raise
`NotImplementedError`, and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) lists what has to happen first.

## 0.0.0 - @SURVEY_DATE@

### Added

- Package skeleton, obligation matrix and CI gates for @NAME@.
- `@PKG@.apps` namespace reserved for composition that is not protocol behaviour.

STRATEGY = """
# Strategy

The completeness matrix is [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md). This document is *why* the rows
are ordered the way they are, and the rules that order has to respect.

## The constitution

1. **The core is the specification implementation.** `@PKG@/` holds codecs, state machines
   and the vocabulary of @NAME@. New core code appears when a document defines the
   behaviour, or when an ordering rule with no document earns an explicit convention label.
2. **Sans-IO before sockets.** Anything decidable from data plus a clock is implemented
   without touching a socket, so every timeout, retry and rollover is testable without
   sleeping or networking.
3. **Dependency-free by default.** An exception needs a sentence in README.md explaining why
   the rule was broken, and a floor with no ceiling.
4. **Positioning is correctness and legibility, not throughput.** The incumbents in this
   corner are usually stale, untyped, or welded to a product. This is the implementation that
   says how it knows what it claims.
5. **Every answer carries its provenance.** Verified or cached, which document, refused or
   believed. An answer without provenance is a guess with a confident type.

## The three tiers

| Tier | Home | Contents | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core | `@PKG@/` | codecs, state machines, policy objects | RFC-cited or convention-labelled |
| Apps | `@PKG@/apps/` | reusable assemblies that compose core | no new protocol surface |
| Examples | `examples/` | one runnable script per use case | configures; never restates logic |

## Interface grammar

One engine, three drives, never parallel implementations:

- **await** -- the native asyncio surface.
- **blocking** -- a facade owning a private loop, so a call from inside a caller's running
  loop works instead of deadlocking.
- **callback** -- plain callables, no third-party promise type.

## Naming

One string everywhere: the distribution, the import and the console script. A name that
means one thing in the installer, in `import` and on `PATH` is the only arrangement that
cannot surprise anyone, and it is also why this project does not sit one edit away from a
project that already exists.
"""

EXAMPLES = """
# examples

One runnable script per use case. An example configures the library; it never restates
library logic, and the prose in the docs quotes these files rather than duplicating them.

Nothing here runs yet: the package surface is stubs that raise `NotImplementedError`. Each
milestone in [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) adds the example that proves it works.

# Part 19: agent instruction files (AGENTS.md + .clinerules + a Cline workflow)
#
# Design notes, grounded in the specs rather than in habit:
#
#   * AGENTS.md (agents.md, now stewarded by the Agentic AI Foundation under the
#     Linux Foundation) is plain Markdown with no required fields. Nested files
#     are resolved by nearest-file precedence, and an explicit prompt in chat
#     overrides all of it. That makes a workspace-level file plus one per project
#     the right shape for a directory of sibling repositories. The workspace file,
#     AGENTS.md at the workspace root, is maintained by hand and is not written from here: the
#     generator once replaced its 4436 characters with a 2517-character template
#     on every run, which is the kind of loss the ownership guard below exists to stop.
#   * Cline reads AGENTS.md, ~/.agents/AGENTS.md, .clinerules/ and .cline/rules/,
#     combining the files found in a rules directory. Conditional rules take a
#     `paths:` glob in YAML front matter and activate when a matching file is in
#     context, so the rfclib procedure can load exactly when protocol code is
#     being edited rather than permanently occupying the context window.
#   * Both agent-guidance sources say the same thing about length: an
#     instruction file should hold only what the agent cannot infer from the
#     repository, and it should give the agent a check it can run. Everything
#     below is therefore commands, invariants and errata pointers; module lists,
#     dependencies and design prose stay in README.md and docs/.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


AGENTS_PROJECT = '''# Instructions for coding agents

<<SUMMARY>>

Primary documents are listed in `docs/rfc-map.md` with statuses and known errata.
The obligation table in `ROADMAP.md` is the work queue, and `README.md` explains
what the library is for. Read those three before changing anything.

## Commands

    python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
    python -m pytest -q
    python -m pytest -q tests/test_roadmap_rows.py
    python -m pytest -q tests/test_public_api.py::test_stubs_are_loud
    python -m ruff check .
    python -m ruff format --check .
    python -m mypy <<PKG>>

The first line installs the dev extras. The six commands after it are the gates,
and all six must pass before a change is finished. CI runs the same set on Linux
and Windows, plus the suite under `python -O`.

## Invariants

These are the points where a plausible-looking change makes the project wrong
rather than merely incomplete.

1. **Roadmap honesty.** Never change a `ROADMAP.md` row from `[ ]` to `[ok]` unless
   the test named in its `Where` cell exists, passes, and would fail if the behaviour
   regressed. A Where cell marked `(to be written)` names a test nobody has written:
   write it, then drop the marker in the same commit that flips the row.
   `tests/test_roadmap_rows.py` checks only that every row names a callable the
   package defines; it cannot tell a passing test from a missing one, so this rule
   is the check. Do not weaken that test, skip it, or delete it to get a green run.
2. **No silent stubs.** Code that is not implemented raises `NotImplementedError`.
   Never return an empty value, an empty collection, or a result object that reports
   success. A protocol library that answers nothing is worse than one that refuses
   to answer, and `tests/test_public_api.py` enforces that every stub is loud.
3. **Normative text is never paraphrased from memory.** Fetch it with `rfclib` and
   cite the section. If the text you fetch does not say what the obligation claims,
   the obligation is wrong: fix the roadmap row and say so in the commit.
4. **Dependencies.** `pyproject.toml` here declares <<DEPS>>. Adding a runtime
   dependency needs a paragraph of justification in `docs/strategy.md` explaining
   why the standard library is not enough.
5. **Scope.** What is deliberately absent is listed under Non-goals in `README.md`.
   An agent that "helpfully" implements a non-goal has expanded the API surface that
   has to be supported forever.

## Read before implementing

<<ERRATA>>

## Protocol work

`.clinerules/10-rfclib.md` describes the `rfclib` calls to make for each obligation
and lists the section refs for this project. If you are not running in Cline, the
same procedure applies: confirm the document, read its errata, pull the normative
statements, then write code.

# Working from the RFC with rfclib

The `rfclib` MCP server is the authority for what a specification says. Model
knowledge of RFC numbers and wording is not reliable here, and this portfolio has
already had to correct numbers that looked right (DHCPv6 is RFC 9915, not 8415;
RRDP is RFC 8182, not 9183).

<<SPINENOTE>>

Work through the obligations in `ROADMAP.md` one row at a time. For each row:

1. **Confirm the document.** `rfclib.info("<<REF>>")` returns status,
   publication date, the updates/obsoletes graph and an errata summary. If the
   document is obsolete or has a successor, stop and flag the roadmap row before
   writing any code.
2. **Read the errata.** `rfclib.errata("<<REF>>")` gives the verified
   corrections with their replacement text. A verified erratum is the
   specification: an implementation that follows the original text is wrong.
   RFC 4795 carries six, RFC 9162 one, RFC 6960 one.
3. **Pull only the normative statements.** `rfclib.read("<<REF>><<SEC0>>",
   view="normative")` returns the MUST, SHOULD and MAY sentences in that scope.
   Read them before choosing a data structure, not after.
4. **Find the specific rule instead of guessing its name.**
   `rfclib.grep("<<REF>>", pattern="<<FIELD>>")` searches one document for a
   field name, ABNF rule or error code, which is cheaper than reading a section.
5. **Cite rather than paraphrase.** `rfclib.cite("<<REF>><<SEC0>>",
   style="verbose")` yields label, title, date, status, anchor URL and errata
   status. Put that in the docstring or the commit message. Never restate normative
   prose in your own words.

Refs accept a bare document (`RFC9162`), a section (append the section symbol and
number), a paragraph within a section, a line range like `RFC9162:120-140`, and a
table like `RFC9162#table-2`. Reads end with `next: <ref>` when the scope exceeds the
budget, so page through rather than guessing. Paragraph markers are printed on each
paragraph so a single one can be quoted exactly.

To decide *which* document applies, `rfclib.search("...", scope="documents")`
matches titles and abstracts while `scope="sections"` says which passage answers the
question. `rfclib.outline("<<REF>>", contains="security")` lists sections
with their line ranges.

## Section refs for this project

<<DOCS>>

## Traps that have already bitten this portfolio

- A status of `INFORMATIONAL` means the document contains no protocol requirements,
  however normative its prose reads. Check before quoting a MUST.
- Numbers move: 6486 became 9286, 8941 became 9651, 4210 became 9810, 7752 became
  9552. Re-read `docs/rfc-map.md` rather than trusting an older note.
- An empty response is a protocol outcome, not a success value. Distinguish "the
  server said no" from "nothing arrived", or you reproduce the RFC 9849 compression
  failure, where a silent empty value made an optional extension load-bearing.

WORKFLOW = '''---
description: Implement one ROADMAP.md obligation, correctly and verifiably
---

Implement the next unchecked row of `ROADMAP.md` in this project, working from
`docs/rfc-map.md` for the document and section.

1. Read the row and quote its spec anchor and evidence cells back. Confirm the
   document with `rfclib.info` and `rfclib.errata` before writing code, and stop if
   it turns out to be obsolete or superseded.
2. Fetch the normative text with `rfclib.read(..., view="normative")`. If what you
   fetch does not state what the row claims, say so and fix the row rather than
   coding to a wrong requirement.
3. Write the test first, using recorded fixtures rather than a live endpoint. Run it
   and watch it fail.
4. Implement the minimum that makes it pass. Anything left unimplemented keeps
   raising `NotImplementedError`.
5. Flip the row to done and name the test in its evidence cell. Do not flip the row
   if the test does not exist and pass.
6. Run every gate listed in `AGENTS.md` and fix what fails.
7. Commit with the citation from `rfclib.cite` in the message body. No
   `Co-Authored-By` trailer.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Part 20: portfolio position (docs/plan.md)
#
# PORTFOLIO.md at the workspace root decides which projects are worked on, in
# what order, and against what. ROADMAP.md inside a project decides protocol
# obligations. Nothing inside a generated repository carried the first of
# those, so an agent reading one project alone could not tell that its wave is
# 4, that two other projects are allowed to be in flight before it, or that
# the codec it plans to verify signatures with has no code anywhere.
#
# What this part writes is a transcription of PORTFOLIO.md sections 4, 6 and 7
# - tier, wave, and the arrows that mean "cannot deliver behaviour without" -
# rather than a reinterpretation of them. Section 10 of that file records the
# ASN.1 role having been mis-assigned to asnkit, with the correction that
# until asn1core exists no certificate-shaped project can ship behaviour. Every
# plan that cites asn1core repeats that sentence, because a caveat kept in one
# file nobody opens is a caveat that gets planned around.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How to state each dependency's current existence, keyed by what deps.py finds on the disk. This used to
# be a static table, and its asn1core entry ("does not exist yet") outlived the fact: asn1core gained a
# package, a test suite and history while nine plans kept asserting the opposite, and nothing re-read
# the claim. The state is now read at generation time, so a plan can only say what the workspace shows.
# What the workspace cannot show is whether a dependency provides the capability a row needs, so the
# "code" text says exactly that and stops.

# The pipeline: render, polish, decide who owns each file, then write or report
#
# One function renders every file a project gets, so there is one place that says what the generator
# writes. It replaces a chain in which build() was reassigned three times, each wrapper calling the one
# before it, so the write set had to be traced through the module to be known - and the first wrapper
# wrote D:\code\AGENTS.md as a side effect of building whichever project came first.
#
# Nothing reaches the disk without passing decide(), which applies D17 of docs/improvement-plan.md: the
# generator stops owning a file when the file differs from what the generator last wrote there, when
# the project's ROADMAP.md has a done row, or when a module has no NotImplementedError left. Measured
# before this existed, one unguarded run would have turned ctspy's sct.py from 8174 bytes of
# implementation into a 1398-byte stub and dropped its six [ok] rows. docs/plan.md is exempt from the
# done-row rule only: it holds no hand work, and the cost D17 names for a stricter rule is exactly that
# implemented projects would stop getting their position regenerated.
#
# What the generator last wrote is the manifest, forge_data/generated.json: a SHA-256 per project and
# path, recorded after every write. A file with no record was written before the manifest existed, so
# nothing says whether it was edited since. Such a file is kept, and reported, unless --adopt is given
