"""Compare what each generated plan claims about a dependency with what is on disk.

Why this exists. Every dependent's `docs/plan.md` says `asn1core` "does not exist yet", and the sentence
was true when it was generated. `asn1core` now has a package, a test suite and history, and nothing
re-read the claim. A board that copied "Blocked: asn1core" from that prose would be asserting something
nobody checked, which is the failure this portfolio is built against.

What it deliberately does not do. It reports the *state* of a dependency (absent, plan only, code) and
which plans contradict it. It does not say a dependent is unblocked: whether a package that exists provides
the capability an edge needs (a CMS codec, an OCSP parser) is a per-edge question that prose cannot answer
and a file count cannot either. A stale claim is a finding; "unblocked" is a decision for a person.

Usage:
    python deps.py                 # table of dependencies and which plans are stale
    python deps.py --check         # exit 1 when any plan contradicts the disk
