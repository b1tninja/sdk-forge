"""Project each SDK's obligation matrix onto GitHub issues, and report when the two disagree.

Why this lives in the forge and not in a project. Filing a project's plan is not part of that project's
product, and a library repo that carries the tooling publishing its roadmap ends up holding credentials
it has no reason to hold. One tool over every project also means one place where the roadmap shapes are
understood, instead of eighteen copies fixing the same bug differently.

Why the markdown stays authoritative. Each project's `tests/test_roadmap_rows.py` reads its matrix, and
the portfolio rule is that a row moves to done only when a named test would fail if the behaviour
regressed. CI can enforce that by reading a file; it cannot enforce a board. So issues are derived from
the document, never the reverse. What issues add is the cloud surface: something to assign, comment on and
close, so an agent without a local clone can take work and know what "done" means.

The grammar (rows, statuses, ladders, evidence) is roadmap.py's; this module only maps it onto issues. A
project resolves to its directory (itulib lives in itulibrary), its matrix file (ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md or
docs/roadmap.md) and its GitHub repository (read from the checkout's own remote).

Safety, because this writes to many repositories at once:

- Idempotence comes from a marker line hidden in each body, matched instead of titles, so a re-run or a
  renamed title cannot fork an issue.
- Every read happens before the first write, and a read that failed or may be truncated stops that
  project: an empty answer read as "no issues yet" used to file a duplicate for every open row.
- Only the labels and milestones that rows will actually carry are created, and only when absent.
- Writes are paced under GitHub's secondary limits for content-creating requests (80 a minute, 500 an
  hour). When the hour's budget is spent the run stops and says where; re-running continues from there.
- Nothing is written without `--apply`; `--check` is for CI and exits non-zero on drift in either
  direction (an open row whose issue is closed, a done row whose issue is open, a milestone mismatch, a
  row with no issue, an issue with no row, a read that failed) while writing nothing.

The Project V2 board is board.py's, not this tool's.
