"""The generator's templates are guarded here, because nothing else exercises them.

`forge.py` writes managed files into every generated project, and its templates are strings: a linter
checks that the Python compiles, not that the CI it emits actually works. Two defects in these strings
were only found when a generated repository ran CI for the first time - `check_dist.py` inspecting a
wheel nothing had built, and an audit that cloned the private project over an anonymous git URL. This
file is where those two stay fixed.

It also guards the shape of the file itself. `forge.py` was assembled by concatenation and its
`__main__` guard must remain at the very end: a guard placed earlier would call run() before the
wrappers that follow had reassigned build, and artefacts would silently stop being written. An
accidental bare `run()` at module scope would rewrite every generated project the moment something
imported the module to inspect it - which is what these tests do.
