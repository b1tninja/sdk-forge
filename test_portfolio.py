## 7. Waves and sequencing

**Wave 0 - hygiene, no features.** Give every project a history. *Exit:* thirty directories
with `git log`.

*Wave 0 status:* later prose that is not the exit test.

**Wave 1 - the chokepoint.** Build it. *Exit:* the corpus passes.

**Wave 5 - the rest, in tier order, one at a time.**

**Hard rule:** two at once.

## 8. Next

## 9. Decisions that need a human

1. **`asn1core`, and how.** Long story. **Decided 2026-11-05 and carried out.**
2. **`certledger` as a flagship service.** Costs money.
   Second line.
9. **`trustatlas`, and what it may publish.** *Name:* **decided 2026-11-05.** Posture open.
