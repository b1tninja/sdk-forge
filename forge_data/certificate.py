"""Generator data for the certificate-shaped shells: PKIX, CT, revocation, enrollment, CMS, OpenPGP, STIR/SHAKEN and SRTP keying.

Moved verbatim out of forge.py, which keeps the logic. PROJECTS lists one dict per project in the
order forge.PROJECT_ORDER expects; OPEN_QUESTIONS feeds section 5 of each generated ROADMAP.md.
Editing a value here changes what the generator would write; run `python forge.py --check` to see
which files that touches before anything is written.
