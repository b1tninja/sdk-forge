"""The loop's selector: its ordering, the two-project rule, and the things it refuses to decide.

Nothing here touches the network or a token. The board is invented cards, exactly as test_projects_mcp.py
does it, and the two IO seams (a project's matrix rows, and deps.py) are stubbed. That is deliberate: the
policy under test is which row is next, and a test that needed the live board would be testing GitHub.

One seam is deliberately not stubbed: blockings() is also called against the real deps.py, because stubbing it
everywhere is what let a wrong field name survive there. A stub cannot catch a misspelled attribute.
