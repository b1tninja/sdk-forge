"""Generator data for the routing shells: RPKI, RTR, ASN data, BGP path attributes, BMP, RPSL, BGP feeds, route validation and looking glasses.

Moved verbatim out of forge.py, which keeps the logic. PROJECTS lists one dict per project in the
order forge.PROJECT_ORDER expects; OPEN_QUESTIONS feeds section 5 of each generated ROADMAP.md.
Editing a value here changes what the generator would write; run `python forge.py --check` to see
which files that touches before anything is written.
