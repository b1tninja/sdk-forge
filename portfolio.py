"""The portfolio as data: every project, its kind, tier, wave and state, the waves' exit tests, and the open
decisions. Read from the files that already say so; nothing here is a second copy of a fact.

Sources, in order of authority:

- PORTFOLIO.md section 4 (tiers), section 7 (waves and their exit tests) and section 9 (decisions that need a
  human). Waves and decisions are parsed from the prose, so the board quotes the plan rather than
  paraphrasing it.
- forge.POSITION for the generated shells' tier, wave and dependency arrows (itself a transcription of
  PORTFOLIO.md sections 4 and 6, checked by the forge's own tests).
- the disk, through deps.py, for whether a project is absent, a plan, a shell or code, and its obligation
  table (ROADMAP.md, or PLAN.md where a project plans there) for how many rows are done.
- each checkout's git remote for its GitHub repository, so a renamed repository (rfclibrary -> rfclib) is
  read, not remembered.

The few projects outside forge.POSITION are listed in EXTRA with the PORTFOLIO.md section they come from.
